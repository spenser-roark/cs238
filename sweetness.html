<h2>EN4</h2>


<p>
You are invited to explore some of the ramifications of polynomial
prime generation as it touches probability theory. This invitation to
exploration is codenamed <i>Sweetness</i>.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>


<p>
Euler's polynomial, <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0001.png"/>, has the <i>sweet</i> feature that
it computes a prime number for every integer <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0002.png"/> in the range <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0003.png"/>, which is 80 primes total. So, in probability terms, the
chances that you will generate a prime by plugging in a random integer
in that range are 100%. So no chance about it, it's certain!
</p>
<p>
Other polynomials of the form <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0004.png"/>, where <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0005.png"/> is some
integer constant, can also generate primes, though maybe not as
reliably as Euler's (which is the special case where <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0006.png"/>).
Obviously, different ranges and constants will vary in the number of
primes generated.
</p>
<p>
Suppose the <i>sweetness</i> of a given range+constant pair is a
quantity with the following properties: The more integers in the range
that generate primes through this constant plugged into the polynomial
(and taking the absolute value, <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0007.png"/>), the higher the
sweetness. But the less <i>uniform</i> the distribution of primes
generated in that range with that constant, the lower the
sweetness. So the first example, with range+constant <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0008.png"/>, is pretty sweet --- it's completely uniform (i.e., there
are zero gaps). But widening the range would potentially lower the
sweetness, because it might less reliably generate primes (i.e., there
are some gaps).
</p>
<p>
How would you define sweetness to quantify these properties? That is
the first challenge of this exploration. Then there is a trade-off
analysis task --- to find a range and a constant that have a sweetness
value as high as possible (up to the arbitrary computational limit of
what intermediate as well as final <img src="ltxpng/sweetness_0009.png"/> values fit in the elisp integer
type). To fix one degree of freedom, which will save some time, use a
constant size of ten thousand for the range.
</p>
<p>
Write code that conducts the sweetness search as systematically as
possible. You must also create a straightforward Sieve of
Eratosthenes implementation to test primality, rather than using a
<b>probabilistic algorithm</b>. Why? Because an <b>isProbablyPrime</b>
function would be overkill --- too sour --- you want sweet
certainty!
</p>

<h3>Expectations</h3>


<p>
In addition to writing elisp code, you are expected to write a
report having a good introduction (stating the goal of this
activity) and conclusion (summarizing your results), and using
correct grammar and spelling throughout.
</p>
<p>
You are also expected to use <b>org mode</b> to write your report.
